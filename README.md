# Design-of-Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian-LQG-controller-for-Gantry-Crane-system-using-MATLAB

• Obtained the non-linear and linearized state-space model of a Gantry Crane with two masses.
• Implemented LQG(LQR control + Kalman filter) controller and optimized the system to asymptotically track a reference using MATLAB.
